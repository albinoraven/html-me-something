                    <h2> Tinder</h2>
                    <p>"This is the oldest of the online dating apps that see regular
                         use.  What was once an app just to hook up with people, is now a combination of that and a dating app.
                         My time on this app was often useless.  My brother said I may be too old, but I saw women of comparable ages on it
                         frequently.  This app started what will be a theme throughout this story: people don't seem that into actually meeting
                         via these apps.  What may even be a promising first few texts will inexplicably just end. With no further contact. 
                         A female friend let me in on some insider rules.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>  Have a question in your profile.</li>
                        <li> After five texts, ask for her number.  </li>
                        <li> Never start by asking someone to meet in person.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        "Since my goal was to use the app as a texting tool essentially as little as possible, I followed these rules.  Which led 
                        to way more dates than inital efforts yielded.  But often people would cancel, seemingly at the drop of a hat.  I was just as guilty,
                        sometimes cancelling just because by the time the date came around I just didn't want to go anymore.  It seemed there was a game afoot, 
                        and it was to not seem that interested for fear of seeming <em>too</em> interested."

                    <h2>Bumble</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Bumble marked a turning point from Tinder.  Women were forced to message the men first after matching.  It also got rid of Tinder's swipe limit
                        and would let you know if there were people coming up in your queue that would match you.  I'm going to admit something here that I know most of my 
                        guy friends did.  We would swipe right on <em>every</em> person, no matter what, and then filter the matches on the back end.  This allowed for maximum
                        realization of potential matches.  But did make you feel bad when someone you would never have matched sent a message before you could unmatch them. Is 
                        it a dirty method, admittedly yes.  Also, effective.  I used Tinder with the mantra that a wider net catches more fish, but was also uninterested in one 
                        night stands.  I used Bumble pretty heavily for the reason that more people on the app actually seemed interested in both meeting and finding someone to date.
                        However, I learned here that women (and maybe men, I have no idea what other people's profiles look like) are exceptionally good at putting up the most flattering
                        possible pictures."

                    <p>
                        "On one particular first date, I had exchanged more than a few messages with a girl who was actually interesting, seemed interested in me, and we met for coffee.
                        Upon arrival to the coffee shop, I surveyed the room, and after seeing a little person and a black guy, decided to order something while I waited for her to arrive.
                        As I was in line, the little person was making constant eye contact.  It was clear to me, her pictures betrayed not a single clue as to her height or proportions. 
                        I'll be the first to say that there is someone for everyone, but it is hard to get past such a large initial deception.  Especially when the mismatch between us was
                        incredible as I am over six feet tall.  We converesed for a few hours and then parted ways, never to text again."

                    <h2>Hinge</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Hinge was an interesting addition to the app market.  It existed a long time ago, but was canned for awhile with hopes of a rework.  I dare say the rework was successful.
                        It allowed you to post a few pictures, answer more than a few questions that were displayed in a small info section, but, most importantly, it forced a few conversation 
                        starters such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> "What is an embarassing moment you've had?"</li>
                        <li> "Truth or Dare?"</li>
                        <li> "What superpower would you want?"</li>
                    <p>
                        "This combination of changes, along with the ability to like any one picture or quote and add a comment, really allowed for a more organic beginning to a conversation.  
                        It showed the other person that you liked a particular thing, and allowed you to respond to it, or explain why you liked it.  But, alas, this still was hard to turn into 
                        a physical meeting in person most times.  I had started to get the impression that a lot of people were present on these apps in order to fill their downtime with somone 
                        to text.  I float this particular theory due to a few people outwardly admitting that up front.  But, dating is a numbers game and you have to keep trying, right?"

                    <h2>Coffee Meets Bagel</h2>
                    <p>
                        "This was my favorite app.  On launch, it allowed you only <em><strong>one</em></strong> possible match a day.  But the profiles had much more information.  This seemed 
                        to make people really think about whether or not a profile was a match, and if it wasn't a match, it let you give a reason why.  Now it gives you a handful of possible matches a day. 
                        And has a few microtransaction features.  But it still gives you the most information and once someone matches, they will show up immediately on your list.  After that you can 
                        decide whether they are a good fit or not.  It is on this app that I met who I will describe as the most intersting person I have had the luck to talk to.  I deleted all the preceding apps 
                        following our first date, only keeping this one so I could look back on the conversation to better remember the things she said. I find it funny, because I almost didn't even go to the
                        first date because I was hungover.  And now we simply can't seem to stop talking to each other about everything."
